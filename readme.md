# SchedulerV2 Service

## Overview
SchedulerV2 is a robust scheduling service designed to manage and process scheduled tasks efficiently. It leverages a microservice architecture to ensure scalability and reliability. The service is built with Go and utilizes a variety of libraries and tools to maintain high performance and ease of use.

## Features
- **Task Scheduling:** Ability to schedule tasks with a specified retry logic.
- **ZooKeeper Integration:** Utilizes Apache ZooKeeper for distributed coordination and configuration management.
- **Database Support:** Integrates with PostgreSQL using GORM for object-relational mapping.
- **Environment Configuration:** Supports environment-based configuration for easy deployment across different stages.
- **Docker Support:** Containerized with Docker for simplified scaling and deployment.
- **Callback Mechanism:** Provides a callback system to notify client services upon task completion or failure.
